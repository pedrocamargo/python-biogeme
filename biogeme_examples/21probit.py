# This estimates a binary probit model. All observations where Swissmetro was chosen are discarded



#Parameters to be estimated

# Arguments:

#   1  Name for report. Typically, the same as the variable

#   2  Starting value

#   3  Lower bound

#   4  Upper bound

#   5  0: estimate the parameter, 1: keep it fixed

# Utility functions



#If the person has a GA (season ticket) her incremental cost is actually 0 

#rather than the cost value gathered from the

# network data. 

TRAIN_COST =  TRAIN_CO   * (  GA   ==  0  )



# For numerical reasons, it is good practice to scale the data to

# that the values of the parameters are around 1.0. 

# A previous estimation with the unscaled data has generated

# parameters around -0.01 for both cost and time. Therefore, time and

# cost are multipled my 0.01.



# The following statements are designed to preprocess the data. It is

# like creating a new columns in the data file. This should be

# preferred to the statement like

# TRAIN_TT_SCALED = TRAIN_TT / 100.0

# which will cause the division to be reevaluated again and again,

# throuh the iterations. For models taking a long time to estimate, it

# may make a significant difference.
