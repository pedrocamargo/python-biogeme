# For numerical reasons, it is good practice to scale the data to
# that the values of the parameters are around 1.0. 
# A previous estimation with the unscaled data has generated
# parameters around -0.01 for both cost and time. Therefore, time and
# cost are multipled my 0.01.

# however complicated it is. Note the quotes in the Derive opertor.

genelas2 = Derive(prob2,'SM_TT') * SM_TT / prob2

# Second, the elasticity of logit models. See Ben-Akiva and Lerman for
# the formula

logitelas1 = TRAIN_AV_SP * (1.0 - prob1) * TRAIN_TT_SCALED * B_TIME
