# cost are multipled my 0.01.


# The following statements are designed to preprocess the data. It is
# like creating a new columns in the data file. This should be
# preferred to the statement like
# TRAIN_TT_SCALED = TRAIN_TT / 100.0
# which will cause the division to be reevaluated again and again,
# throuh the iterations. For models taking a long time to estimate, it
# may make a significant difference.
