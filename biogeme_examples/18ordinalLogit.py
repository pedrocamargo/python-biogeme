# This model is not appropriate for the data. We include it to
# illustrate the syntax for an ordered logit model.  We assume here
# that the response (1,2,3) is ordered. The higher the utility, the
# higher the response.


#Parameters to be estimated
# Arguments:
#   - 1  Name for report; Typically, the same as the variable.
#   - 2  Starting value.
#   - 3  Lower bound.
#   - 4  Upper bound.
#   - 5  0: estimate the parameter, 1: keep it fixed.

#If the person has a GA (season ticket) her incremental cost is actually 0

# For numerical reasons, it is good practice to scale the data to
# that the values of the parameters are around 1.0. 
# A previous estimation with the unscaled data has generated
# parameters around -0.01 for both cost and time. Therefore, time and
# cost are multipled my 0.01.

# The following statements are designed to preprocess the data. It is
# like creating a new columns in the data file. This should be
# preferred to the statement like
# TRAIN_TT_SCALED = TRAIN_TT / 100.0
# which will cause the division to be reevaluated again and again,
# throuh the iterations. For models taking a long time to estimate, it
# may make a significant difference.
