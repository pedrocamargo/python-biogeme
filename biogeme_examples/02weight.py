# that the values of the parameters are around 1.0. 
# A previous estimation with the unscaled data has generated
# parameters around -0.01 for both cost and time. Therefore, time and
# cost are multipled my 0.01.
# The use of user-defined expressions optimizes the run of
# biogeme. Indeed, user-defined expressions are evaluated before the
# estimation starts, and stored as data. This may lead to a
# significant gain of estimation time.
